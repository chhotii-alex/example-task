# How to get this running

- Install and run the Spring Boot [Prospective Randomizer)[https://github.com/chhotii-alex/prospective-randomizer?tab=readme-ov-file#compiling-and-running] somewhere.
- Install `npm` on your computer.
- `git clone` this repo.
- `cd` into this repo's root directory on your computer
- enter the `npm install` command
- `npm run build`
- `npm run preview`
- When you run `npm run preview` it will show you in the terminal window a URL for the task page. Enter that URL in a browser on a device on the local network.

If any of this doesn't work as advertised, please open an Issue and vent me all the details, thanks!
